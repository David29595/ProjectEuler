# ProjectEuler
A repository to hold some of my ProjectEuler solutions. Code for the challenges is in the challenges folder, and each challenge has a test in the tests folder.


To run the tests, Pytest is required. 

This can be installed using `pip install pytest`

and the tests can be run by running `pytest` from the `python` or `root` directory of the project.
